# Snake Game in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) or WASD keys.
- **Food Generation**: Randomly generates food for the snake to eat.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and displays the score as the snake eats food.
- **Game Over**: Ends the game if the snake runs into itself.
- **Restart**: Press `R` to restart the game after a game over.

## Getting Started
